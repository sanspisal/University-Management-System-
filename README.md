# University-Management-System-Project

A streamlined application to manage student and faculty records using C++ and MySQL, following OOP principles.

##Features

Manage university records for students and faculty.
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for efficient data handling.
Integration of C++ with MySQL for backend database operations.
Modular design using OOP principles: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Dynamic user interactions with Windows API (windows.h).
Delayed features using Sleep() for enhanced user experience.

##Technologies Used

Programming Language: C++.
Database Management: MySQL.
Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

##Setup Instructions

Prerequisites
Install MySQL on your system.
Install a C++ compiler like GCC or an IDE like Code::Blocks/Dev-C++.
Install necessary MySQL C++ libraries (mysql.h).

##Usage

Follow the on-screen instructions to:
Add new records.
Search for existing records.
Update or delete records.
Display all stored records.
Data is securely stored and retrieved from the MySQL database.

##Code Highlights

Database Connectivity: Used MySQL APIs like mysql_store_result() and mysql_fetch_row().
OOP Principles: Encapsulation (getter and setter functions), inheritance, and polymorphism for a maintainable and scalable structure.
Dynamic UX: Leveraged Windows API for interactive user experiences with dynamic delays.

##Future Enhancements

Add role-based access for students and faculty.
Introduce a GUI using a framework like Qt.
Extend functionality to include attendance and grade records.

## Setting Up the Database

1. Install MySQL and set up the environment.
2. Open a terminal or MySQL Workbench.
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd UniversityManagementSystem
